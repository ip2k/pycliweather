The problem: I want to look up the weather from wunderground from my terminal without opening up a web browser. I figured "hey, this should be easy / fun to do using Python!" -- WRONG! XML is always a pain to work with, and there is no *easy* way to get XML schema into a dict. Most people don't even use XML correctly; you should use JSON if you just have strings inside of XML tags and nothing more. Every API I've ever seen / worked with uses XML in this way, and so they could all replace it with the *much* easier to parse JSON.

Update: You can now pass in the location as the first argument to the script. Currently only the first word before a space is supported due to some issues with urlencode that I don't feel like solving right this second. You can use *any* location search format that wunderground supports; this includes zipcode, airport code, city name, etc. In the example below, I'm using 'sfo' which is the airport code for San Francisco, CA. There is also a default specified in the code should a location not be passed.

Anyway, here is what should come out when you run this:
1	likwid@helios python$ weather sfo
2	Location: sfo
3	Sunrise: 5:47
4	Sunset: 20:32
5	Moon visible: 100%
6	 
7	Wednesday - Clear - 54F to 72F - 0% chance of rain
8	Thursday - Clear - 52F to 65F - 0% chance of rain
9	Friday - Partly Cloudy - 52F to 63F - 0% chance of rain
10	Saturday - Partly Cloudy - 52F to 63F - 0% chance of rain
11	Sunday - Partly Cloudy - 58F to 70F - 0% chance of rain
12	Monday - Clear - 59F to 70F - 0% chance of rain

Perfect! Here is the code, which is much longer than I'd like for it to be. I would have used xpath, but apparently my lxml version didn't have that.
